  <h2>What is Sinap?</h2>
  <p>
    Sinap is not a plot IDE. The goal of Sinap is to provide a generic UI platform for editing and interpreting domain-specific
    graph-based languages. What does this mean? Let's break it down. Users of Sinap want to design visual representations
    of state machines or other conceptual tools that can be modeled with nodes and edges but don't want to have to create
    their own UI to handle all the fancy drawing stuff. Sinap IDE will provide the heavy lifting for presenting the visual
    side of creating graphs as well as running interpreters for them. Where do these interpreters come from? Plugins. Sinap
    IDE will expose an API that developers can use to create their own domain-specific interpreters of languages that can
    be modeled with graphs. These plugins can then be installed into Sinap, giving the IDE more power.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are many options for graph editors available, but the vast majority of them are designed specifically for their respective
    domains. Sinap IDE aims to break this trend by allowing developers implement their own interpreters that can be used
    in the application. Think of a lightweight text editor for writing code but replace "text" with "graph" and add interpreting
    and that is what Sinap aims to be. What do we mean by "interpret"? Sinap is not a tool for simple chart designs. The
    idea behind Sinap plugins is to be able to feed graphs some input in order to see what the graph produces. Imagine a
    tool that allows you to step through a state machine that you designed for a project. With the right plugin, this is
    possible with Sinap IDE.</p>
